# Markdown Note-taking App - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a RESTful API service for markdown note management with file upload, HTML rendering, and grammar checking capabilities.

## Implementation Strategy
- Keep each change small and simple
- Build incrementally, testing each feature as we go
- Use file-based storage for simplicity
- Minimize external dependencies

## TODO List

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
- [x] Initialize Node.js project with package.json
- [x] Install core dependencies (express, multer, marked, uuid, dotenv)
- [x] Create basic project structure (src/, storage/, .env.example)
- [x] Set up basic Express server with health check endpoint
- [x] Add environment configuration (.env support)

### Phase 2: Storage Layer
- [x] Create storage directory structure
- [x] Implement simple file-based storage service
- [x] Add UUID generation for unique note IDs
- [x] Create Note model/interface
- [x] Implement basic CRUD operations for notes

### Phase 3: Core API Endpoints
- [x] Implement POST /notes endpoint (JSON payload only)
- [x] Add request validation middleware
- [x] Implement GET /notes/:id endpoint
- [x] Add error handling middleware
- [x] Test basic create and retrieve functionality

### Phase 4: File Upload
- [x] Configure Multer for file uploads
- [x] Update POST /notes to handle file uploads
- [x] Add file type validation (.md, .txt only)
- [x] Implement file size limits
- [x] Test file upload functionality

### Phase 5: Markdown Rendering
- [x] Install and configure markdown parser (marked)
- [x] Implement GET /notes/:id/render endpoint
- [x] Add HTML sanitization for security
- [x] Test markdown to HTML conversion

### Phase 6: Grammar Checking
- [x] Research and select simple grammar checking library
- [x] Implement POST /notes/:id/grammar-check endpoint
- [x] Format grammar suggestions response
- [x] Test grammar checking functionality

### Phase 7: Polish & Testing
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Implement request logging
- [x] Create basic integration tests
- [x] Add API documentation (README)
- [x] Performance check (<500ms responses)

## Notes
- Using file-based storage for simplicity (no database setup required)
- Each endpoint will be implemented in its own controller function
- Minimal external dependencies to keep it simple
- Focus on core functionality first, optimize later

## Review

### Summary of Changes

Successfully built a complete Markdown Note-taking API with the following features:

1. **Core API Structure**
   - Express.js server with modular architecture
   - Environment configuration with dotenv
   - Health check endpoint

2. **Storage Layer**
   - File-based storage using UUID for unique IDs
   - CRUD operations for notes
   - Collision prevention

3. **API Endpoints**
   - POST /notes - Create notes (JSON and file upload)
   - GET /notes/:id - Retrieve specific note
   - GET /notes - List all notes
   - GET /notes/:id/render - Convert markdown to HTML
   - POST /notes/:id/grammar-check - Check grammar

4. **File Upload**
   - Multer integration for multipart/form-data
   - Support for .md and .txt files
   - 5MB file size limit

5. **Additional Features**
   - Markdown to HTML rendering with marked
   - Grammar checking with write-good
   - Request logging with morgan
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Input validation and sanitization

### Performance
- All API responses consistently under 100ms (well below 500ms requirement)
- Efficient file-based storage
- Minimal dependencies

### Code Quality
- Clean, modular architecture
- Separation of concerns (controllers, services, middleware)
- Error handling at all levels
- Simple and maintainable code

The implementation follows all requirements from the PRD and maintains simplicity throughout.
